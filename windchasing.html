<p><em>&quot;There is nothing new under the sun.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Using the Common English Bible (CEB) translation, local performer Benjamin Wesley brings the ancient words of the anonymous author often referred to as &quot;Qoholet&quot;--the Teacher--to vivid life in this one-hour presentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%201&amp;version=CEB">Ecclesiastes</a> is both a work of &quot;wisdom literature&quot; (like the book of Proverbs that it comes after) and a subversion of it. <em>&quot;Remember,&quot;</em> Qoholet tells us, <em>&quot;in much wisdom is much aggravation--the more knowledge, the more pain.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In his quest to find the meaning of life, Qoholet is both profound and surprisingly cynical, constantly repeating that everything is &quot;chasing after wind,&quot; but affirming the goodness of resting in your work and enjoying the fruit of your labors--that is, if you&#39;re able to.</p>
<p>No matter whether you&#39;re Christian, atheist, something else, or something in-between, <em>Wind-Chasing</em> will be a thought-provoking and surprising production that will likely leave you saying, &quot;Wait, that&#39;s in the <em>Bible?</em>&quot;
